Functional Programming concepts and principles:
1- First class functions (first-class citizen functions)
  It means that a function in JavaScript is just another value that we can:
    - pass to other functions
    - save in a variable
    - return from other functions
    
2- Higher order function 
3- Pure functions and side-effects
